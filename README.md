Copyright Infrigement : The regressive right (MSX2)
===================================================
by gameblabla

Warning : 18+ only, don't play this kids !

MSX2 version, based upon the original Colecovision/MegaROM game.
This one has a few graphical improvements as well as another addition : speech !
The game remains the same otherwise and features FMVs on a 512k ASCII16 bankswitched game.

This was also originally going to feature more voices but i hit the 512kb limit.
I wanted this game to be playable on real hardware so i decided to play it safe for now.

Story
======

Rikuto has trapped you in yet another of his sick games.
This time, he made you the male bride of Siciel and he expects of you to be a good boy !
Show him what you're capable of !

Compilation
============

This requires libmsx.
Make sure to export LIBMSX_HOME or set it manually in the Makefile.
Make sure to edit compile_flags.txt as well !
Then building it should be easy with make...

TODO
====

- MSX2+/TurboR version with enhanced graphics.
- MSX1 version (Will be the same as Colecovision except with speech)
